<p>The Pisticci Farm Project is a project of the Upper Manhattan restaurant <a href="http://www.pisticcinyc.com/">Pisticci</a>. The project has three elements:</p>
<ul>
<li><em>engaging</em> the <strong>restaurant</strong> staff and patrons</li>
<li>creating <em>zero waste</em> through <a href="#compost"><strong>composting</strong></a> within the city</li>
<li><em>producing</em> high-quality vegetables for Pisticci on the <a href="#farm"><strong>multi-site farm</strong></a></li>
</ul>
<p>This document outlines the technologies and processes involved in the composting and farming elements of the project.</p>
<p><a name="compost"></a> ## Compost</p>
<p>The discarded organic material from Pisticci restaurant are separated at source (ie. the kitchen, bar, etc.) from other 'waste'. These materials are composted using an oxygenated hot composting method to ensure rapid decomposition, no unpleasant odours and the creation of a high quality fertiliser and biological innoculum for the soil at the <a href="#farm">farm</a>.</p>
<h3 id="aerated-static-pile-asp-composting">Aerated Static Pile (ASP) Composting</h3>
<p>Pisticci is using the aerated static pile (ASP) method of composting as developed by Peter Moon of <a href="http://www.o2compost.com">O<sup>2</sup> Compost</a>.</p>
<p>The Pisticci ASP system using includes three enclosed boxes which are bottem-fed pressurised air through <em>100 mm</em> (<em>4 in</em>) from a blower mounted above the bins.</p>
<h4 id="organic-material-collection-process">Organic Material Collection Process</h4>
<ul>
<li>Organic materials are collected in white plastic bags by the restaurant staff and deposited in wheelie-bins next to the compost bins.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Establishing a new Pile</strong></p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>Ensure that all pipes in the manifold in the bottom of the bin are present and properly fitted together.</li>
<li>Add woodchips to just cover the pipes and thoroughly moisten the woodchips.</li>
<li>Open the valve above the bin to ensure that air will flow into the pile while composting proceeds.</li>
</ol>
<p>Organic materials may now be added.</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>The Bins</strong> are 5' long, 4' high and 3' wide to fit within the small alleyway behind the restaurant.</li>
<li><strong>The Blower</strong></li>
<li><strong>The Timer</strong> is set to be on for 2 minutes every 30 minutes to ensure the piles remain oxygenated.</li>
